**Autonomous Driving System Evaluation Metrics**

A comprehensive set of evaluation dimensions and metrics to assess the safety, robustness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of autonomous driving systems.

---

## 1. Safety

* **Disengagement Rate**: Number of human interventions per 1,000 miles or kilometers driven.
* **Accident Rate**: Number of collisions or safety-critical incidents per test distance or hours.
* **Near-Miss Rate**: Number of events where the system narrowly avoided a collision.
* **Extreme Scenario Handling Success Rate**: Percentage of correct responses in rare or emergency situations (e.g., pedestrian darting into the road, high-speed cut-ins).
* **Safety-Critical HMI Alerts**: Number of emergency alerts or warnings issued to the driver.

## 2. Operational Design Domain (ODD)

### 2.1 Environmental Conditions

* **Weather Coverage**: Number of supported weather conditions and test miles under each (clear, cloudy, light/moderate/heavy rain, light/moderate/heavy snow, light/dense fog, hail, strong winds).
* **Lighting Conditions Support**: Test mileage in daylight, nighttime, dawn, dusk, tunnels, and sudden lighting transitions.
* **Visibility Range**: Effective perception distance under different visibility levels (fog, rain, snow).

### 2.2 Geographic Domain

* **Road Type Coverage**: Proportion of test miles on highways, urban roads, suburban roads, rural roads, and private roads.
* **Topology Robustness**: Success rate in handling intersections, roundabouts, construction zones, and complex road layouts.

### 2.3 Traffic Conditions

* **Traffic Density Adaptability**: Average speed and safety metrics under light, moderate, and heavy traffic.
* **Dynamic Object Diversity**: Detection and avoidance accuracy for various road users (cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, animals).
* **Behavioral Edge Cases**: Success rate in responding to non-standard behaviors (running red lights, aggressive lane changes, sudden braking).

## 3. Vehicle Operational Constraints

* **Speed Range Compliance**: Percentage of time the system stays within specified minimum and maximum speed limits.
* **Load & Weight Impact**: Variation in braking distance and acceleration under different load conditions (unladen vs. fully loaded).
* **Vehicle Type Adaptation**: Performance benchmarks for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and special-purpose vehicles.

## 4. Computational Performance

* **Inference Latency**: Average and maximum delay of perception and decision-making modules.
* **Throughput**: Sustained processing capability (frames per second) at target sensor rates.
* **Resource Utilization**: CPU, GPU, memory, and network bandwidth usage.
* **Power Consumption**: Energy usage of the onboard compute platform under typical load.

## 5. Robustness & Reliability

* **Failure Rate**: Frequency of software or hardware failures leading to degraded performance or system resets.
* **Recovery Time**: Time required for the system to return to normal operation after a fault or anomaly.
* **Sensor Degradation Handling**: Performance retention rate when sensors are partially obstructed or degraded.

## 6. User Experience

* **Comfort Metrics**: Lateral and longitudinal acceleration variation, counts of harsh acceleration or braking events.
* **Ride Smoothness Score**: Composite rating based on passenger feedback and acceleration signals.
* **Driver Interaction Frequency**: Number of manual overrides or driver alerts per distance.

## 7. Efficiency & Cost

* **Operational Efficiency**: Average trip time, average speed, and route optimality.
* **Operational Cost**: Energy consumption per distance and maintenance costs.
* **Total Cost of Ownership**: Combined hardware, software, maintenance, and operational expenses.
